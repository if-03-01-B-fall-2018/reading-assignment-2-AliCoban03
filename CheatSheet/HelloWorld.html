<h3> 1. What is the html head element?</h3>
<p> Awnser: The < head > element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the < html > tag and the < body > tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information</p>
<h3> 2. What does <!DOCTYPE` html> mean?</h3>
<p> Awnser: The < !DOCTYPE > declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. ... HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.</p>
<h3> 3. What are the two top most elements within the html element?</h3>
<p> Awnser: The < head > and the < body > element</p>
<h3> 4. How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>

<h3> 5. How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>
<p> Awnser: With the < strong > tag and it makes the text look fat/wide</p>
